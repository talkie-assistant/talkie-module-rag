# Modular design (RAG module)

This repo is a **module**. It must be self-contained: only use the **SDK** (and its own code). Do **not** import from `app`, `llm`, or `persistence` of talkie-core. When the module runs as a standalone server, config must be obtained via the module's own config file. The module exposes an HTTP API that core calls for ingest and retrieve.
